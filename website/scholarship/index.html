        JavaScript Bangkok Scholarship
      </h1>
      <p>
        We at JavaScript Bangkok believe in diversity, the equality, thus we
        welcome everyone and anyone to participate in the growing JavaScript
        community in Thailand and around the world.
      </p>
      <h2 id="what-is-the-scholarship">What is the scholarship?</h2>
      <p>
        People who get selected for a scholarship are eligible to receive one free ticket
        to the conference. We also provide financial support for travel and
        accommodation up to 2000 THB.
      </p>
      <p>
        We provide the scholarship to support underrepresented groups in
        Thailand. Sometimes people from other non-tech industries would interest
        in tech conferences but since they have no prior experience about tech
        conferences they might not be convinced the ticket price are worth
        spending. Also most conferences are often held in the capital city like
        Bangkok, people from different provinces might find it uncomfortable to
        travel to Bangkok solely just to attend the conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to close this gap and made quality conferences accessible and
        available to more people. That's why we're introducing the Scholarship
        program
      </p>
      <h2 id="who-can-apply">Who can apply?</h2>
